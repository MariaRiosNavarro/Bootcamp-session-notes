Branch 

- is a branch of main that is branched to develop an extra property or application to the main software in main.

 - main always exists in parallel and is always published, our branch does not.
Only when this branch is finished and added (Merge) to the main Main will the change be present, but the branch after the Merge will be deleted.

- Ensure that you always have a running app (main)

- create a branch and go there:

git switch -c feature/name

(with swicht (without -c ) we can also go to main or back to branch e.g.: git switch main)

- once we have made the branch we can change what we want and then as always, then we have to push the change:

git add .
git commit -m "message
git push



- that someone checks that everything is correct.

pull request in GitHub

if there is a go after the commit,

you can merge and it will all be added to the main project.
(then you have to delete the branch)
