# My first day on github
Today I learned that the version control is an **essential part** of my career as a developer.
Some Keywords I sould remember:
- git,
- GitHUb,
- commit,
- identified by hash,
- repository.

#Now I am going to do a test with everything

##I have learned today about 

###Markdown.



<hr>

This is a list:
- one item
- two item
- tree item

<hr>

This is a ordered list:
1. one ordered item
2. two ordered item
3. tree ordered item

<hr>

Links:

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../.../LICENSE)

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.


<hr>

Underline 

only with HTML:
```
<ins>underline</ins>
```


<hr>

Images:

Inline-style: 

```
![alt text](https://......png "Logo Title Text 1")
```

Reference-style: 

```
![alt text][logo]
[logo] https://.....png "Logo Title Text 2"
```

<hr>

Inline code with 3 back-ticks \`\`\` at the beginning and at the end:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

<hr>

HTML code:
You can also use raw HTML and normally works, but no CSS inline styles. Also you can do the tables with HTML too

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
