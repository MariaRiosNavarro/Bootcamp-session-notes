A shell (like zsh) is the command interpreter that runs and executes commands on your computer and outputs results.


### Basic Shell commands

| command                  | functionality                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`                     | list the content of the current directory                                  |
| `cd <foldername>`        | change directory into a folder                                             |
| `cd ..`                  | change into the parent folder                                              |

| `touch example.md`       | create a file called "example.md"                                          |
| `mkdir newFolder`        | create a folder called "newFolder"                                         |

| `curl <url>`             | prints the received content from the specified url. (try `curl ipinfo.io`) |

pwd  

ls (index of files)
ls -la (index of files with the incognito files)

clear (clear the terminal)

cd file. (go inside the folder)

cd..  (go back to the patern folder)

cd Proj + tab then completes itself

cd../../.. (we can write the complet street to the file)

<ins>do new<ins>:

mkdir new directory

touch new file (erstellt nur ein datei container, nicht ein word oder was auch immer)

<ins>delete<ins>:

rm delete files
rmdir delete FOLDER !! take care!!

<ins>Open/run<ins>:

open  .        (space. is the place where I am and see where we are in finder)
cat filename (we see in Terminal inside the file)

<ins> rename & move <ins>

mv

We do a Challenge, we used only the Terminal:

Why shell:

faster and more efficient

combine chains of processes


We will stuff things to add colours and structure
